Hello! I am a first-year Master’s student in Computer Science at Brown University. I am very interested in AI safety and interpretability and my research focuses on interpreting AI systems to understand how we can precisely align and control them to behave in predictable, human-aligned ways. 

Before Brown, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics–Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I had the opportunity to work with Dr. George Sugihara, Dr. Xi Li, and Dr. Zhuowen Tu on projects spanning ecological forecasting, multimodal models, and robust machine learning.
